This sample test collection provides a test suite with 3 test cases.
Each test case has 5 variants.
One variant succeeds
One variant fails
One variant returns with result code 1
On variant has an script error
One variant is skipped

Additionally the test collection demonstrates the usage of test preparation and 
test finalization steps and the use of test properties.

So the expected result is:

case variants=15 skipped=3 failures=3 errors=6
